### Wing Expansion Menu

The approach of the Wing Expansion Menu is based on two axiomatic assumptions we made about the human navigation in cascading menus that are intuitively true. First, the longer the user stays with the cursor on a menu item, the more likely it is that he wants to select this element. Secondly, the further to the right the userâ€™s cursor is on a menu item, the more likely it is that the user wants to select it. The second is only correct if we assume a cascading menu on the right side. If we accept these two axioms as true, a meaningful
menu should facilitate the selection of menu items which are more likely due to these axioms. The WEM builds on these two axioms, by making use of findings by the Steering Law that a wider steering path leads to a faster and therefore more precise selection.

A user study of a WEM against a standard pull-down menu showed an average improvement of 18.63% in user interaction speed. A second user study, which evaluated one of the significant innovations of the WEM compared to a similar approach, showed an average improvement of 7.01% in user interaction speed.
